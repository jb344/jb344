- 👋 Hi, I’m @jb344 - Jack Burden
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills to enhance my portfolio of abilities, skills not always focused around software, however my favourite languages are C++, 
Python and Java. I take pride in dabbling with Arduino and RPi projects outside of work, alongside cycling, running, strength conditioning and DIY mechanics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FPGA development in my spare time with an Arduno MKR VIDOR 4000. Alongside Karate, learning how to do a muscle up, and general self-improvement!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything software or electronics related!
- 📫 Reach me here.
